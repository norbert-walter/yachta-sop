"Open Boat Projects is a platform where technology-savvy water sports "
"enthusiasts present their DIY projects related to water sports. The idea for"
" this platform was born in the sailing forum and launched by a few people. "
"It all began with a trade fair appearance at Boot 2020, where a variety of "
"DIY projects were presented live. The goal is to demonstrate the tools and "
"technical possibilities available for implementing one's own projects. The "
"projects presented are intended to inspire interested parties to implement "
"their own projects and contribute their own ideas that can be used by "
"others. The focus is on the idea of ​​open source and open hardware as well "
"as the exchange of ideas. A number of interesting projects have already been"

"of ideas takes place in the sailing forum under the section open-boat-"
"projects.org. We invite all interested parties to participate in the "
"exchange of ideas. You don't have to be an expert. Anyone with great ideas "
"is welcome to contribute."
