Build Preparation
=================

	* Verify stencil (thickness, apertures)
	* Solder paste type (e.g., SAC305 lead‑free), shelf life/conditioning
	* Line setup: feeders to positions; cross‑check MPN ↔ BOM/CPL (four‑eyes principle)
	* First article run (1–5 boards) to optimize paste/placement/reflow profile (record & archive)
	* Enable labeling (SN/QR) and traceability
