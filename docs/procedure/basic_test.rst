Basic electrical test
=====================

	* Visual inspection passed
	* Short/continuity test of power rails to GND
	* Power‑on with bench PSU (current limit; typically start <100 mA above expected)
	* Verify reference voltages/regulators, crystal/clock, reset lines
	* Basic comms (USB/UART/I²C/SPI) and programming interface check
	* Record results (Form D1).
