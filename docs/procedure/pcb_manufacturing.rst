PCB Manufacturing
=================

CAM / data check
----------------
- Perform DFM/DRC (clearances, drill/mill, solder mask, impedance)
- Define stack‑up, copper thickness, surface finish (e.g., ENIG/OSP/ImAg) and colors
- Document manufacturing sign‑off

Order / fabrication
-------------------
- Use approved supplier; define quality level (IPC class) and certificates (e.g., CoC)
- Define lot size, panelization, depanel method (V‑score/break‑tabs)

PCB incoming inspection
-----------------------
- Check packaging (ESD, humidity card, desiccant, integrity)
- Sample per IPC‑A‑600: solder mask registration, drill quality, vias, surface finish, dimensions, markings (date code, rev., UL)
- Ensure electrical test (E‑test) certificate included or verify by sample
- Release/hold in ERP/MES; record results (Form A1)
