Component Sourcing & Incoming Inspection
========================================

Sourcing
--------
	* Check BOM for obsolescence; confirm MPN, package, tolerances, temp ranges
	* Purchase from authorized distributors/OEMs; document approved alternates

Incoming inspection
-------------------
	* Label check: manufacturer, MPN, qty, lot/date code, RoHS/REACH
	* Visual check: package damage, leads, MSL bag/indicator
	* Verify MSL; observe moisture handling (dry storage/bake per JEDEC)
	* Plausibility checks (sample measure resistors/capacitors)
	* Release/hold documented (Form B1)
