Functional Test (FCT)
=====================

	* Connect fixture (bed‑of‑nails/connectors); run defined scripts
	* Typical coverage:
		* Current consumption in run/standby
		* Digital I/O, pull‑ups/downs
		* Analog paths (ADC/DAC linearity, references)
		* Communications (CAN, RS‑485, Ethernet, BLE/Wi‑Fi)
		* Sensors/actuators simulated or attached
		* Memories (EEPROM/Flash/RAM) read/write
		* Safety features (watchdog, brown‑out)
	* Limits and pass/fail per test instruction
	* Auto‑attach test results to SN and archive (Form F1, add log)
