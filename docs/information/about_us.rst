About Us
========

Open Boat Projects is a platform where technology-savvy water sports enthusiasts present their DIY projects related to water sports. The idea for this platform was born in the sailing forum and launched by a few people. It all began with a trade fair appearance at Boot 2020, where a variety of DIY projects were presented live. The goal is to demonstrate the tools and technical possibilities available for implementing one's own projects. The projects presented are intended to inspire interested parties to implement their own projects and contribute their own ideas that can be used by others. The focus is on the idea of ​​open source and open hardware as well as the exchange of ideas. A number of interesting projects have already been realized, and more projects will be added in the future. The main exchange of ideas takes place in the sailing forum under the section open-boat-projects.org. We invite all interested parties to participate in the exchange of ideas. You don't have to be an expert. Anyone with great ideas is welcome to contribute.
