Revision History
================

Changes to the document are primarily tracked via the GitHub repository. Meaningful commit descriptions must be used. A separate GitHub user must be created for each responsible party, who can propose corresponding changes to the document via pull requests. The project maintainer then grants approval.

Final versions of an SOP for production are marked with a label and released as a release. The releases must be entered in the list below. The initials of the person responsible for release must be provided.
